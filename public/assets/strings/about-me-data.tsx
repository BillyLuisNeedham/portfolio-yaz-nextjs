    <p>As a freelancer I enjoy working with clients and helping to create their ideas become a reality. I believe that great communication and collaboration between the client(s), designer(s) and engineers(s) is the key to a better, more efficient working environment to be able to achieve a great product.</p>,
    <p> Previous projects includes a Udacity and Udemy course projects. A driving schools website and an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) all in one training assistance app.</p>,
    <p> Leaving my previous career as an Aircraft Technician in the British Army I decided to pursue my love for UX and visual design, looking to solve the problems of the day with technology. Through my experience as an engineer/soldier, I have developed great communication, organisation and management skills that are useful for connecting and understanding people from different backgrounds and cultures. I have experience working to tight but reasonable deadlines in high-temperament, high-stressful situations.</p>
